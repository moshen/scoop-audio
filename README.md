# Scoop Audio Bucket

This is an experimental scoop bucket to install freeware and open source
Audio applications and plugins.

## Setup

```
scoop bucket add scoop-audio 'https://github.com/moshen/scoop-audio.git'
```

## Usage

Currently every manifest will require global since your VST plugins folder is probably
global.

Install like:

```
scoop install sudo
sudo scoop install tal-u-no-62 -g
```
